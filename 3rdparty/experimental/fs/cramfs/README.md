## Introduction
**cramfs** is a compressed ROM filesystem. It uses the zlib routines to compress a file one page at a time, and allow random page access. It also attempts to provide AOS-compatible filesystem behaviour.

### Features
- support file which size is less than 16MB
- Max filesystem size is over 256MB

### Directories

```sh
cramfs
├── aos_cramfs.h # Cramfs register api declaration
└── vfs_cramfs.c # Cramfs vfs adapt layer implementation
```

### Dependencies

### Notes

- Usage:
    - This directory include all the cramfs vfs-adapting files.
    - You should call "vfs\_cramfs\_register" function to mount the cramfs before you can use it.
    - The mount point of the cramfs in AliOS-Things is "/cramfs".

- Building:
    - Get the AliOS-Things porting version cramfs codes first. (you can contact us via https://github.com/alibaba/AliOS-Things)
    - Put the source files under this directory
    - Add component dependency to your target board or your target app. (e.g. `$(NAME)_COMPONENTS += 3rdparty.experimental.fs.cramfs`)
    - Just build and enjoy it !
