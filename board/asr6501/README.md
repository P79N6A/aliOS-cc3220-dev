## Overview

The ASR6501 is a general LoRa Wireless Communication Chipset, with integrated LoRa Radio Transceiver, LoRa Modem and a 32-Bit RISC MCU. The MCU uses ARM Cortex M0+, with 48MHz operation frequency. The LoRa Radio Transceiver has continuous frequency coverage from 150MHz to 960MHz. The LoRa Modem supports LoRa modulation for LPWAN use cases and (G)FSK modulation for legacy use cases. The LoRa Wireless Communication module designed by ASR6501 provides ultra long range, ultra low power communication for LPWAN application.

ASR6501 is compiled by cypress IDE(psoc6)
